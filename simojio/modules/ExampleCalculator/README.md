## Description:		
This is an example module of the type "Calculator". A Calculator has to return numerical results 
in the method get_results_dict(). All defined numerical results can be used for optimization. 

If you want to create a module of this type by yourself, just copy the whole directory into the 
"modules" directory of simoji and replace "ExampleCalculator" by the name of your module at the 
following 3 places:
1) Folder name
2) python file name
3) class name within your python file

Note: You have to use the same name for all 3 places otherwise the module will not work.
